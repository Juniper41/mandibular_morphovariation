# Mandibular Morphovariation Project
This repo contains information on how small mammals' evolutionary response can allow them to persist in a changing landscape. Evolutionary response will be tracked via mandibular shape change through time. It's part of a greater project looking at how evolutionary and plastic response work in parallel and/or independently to help buffer speciation across temporal and spatial scales. 

Landmarking coordinates for each species can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/Juniper41/mandibular_morphovariation/tree/main/data)

## Study Systems
This project looks at morphological variation of small mammal dentary bones from Two Ledges Chamber, NV and Homestead Cave, UT over the last ~10,000 years. This is just one of the proxies at understanding how small mammals adapt to a changing landscape. 

The two systems have different anthropogenic histories and resource bases.

## Temporal Scale
This project spans a temporal scale in to the mid holocene. Below is the temporal scale I use and the associated date range for each stratum.
