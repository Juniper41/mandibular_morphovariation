# Mandibular Morphovariation Project
This repo contains information on how small mammals' evolutionary response can allow them to persist in a changing landscape. Evolutionary response will be tracked via mandibular shape change through time. It's part of a greater project looking at how evolutionary and plastic response work in parallel and/or independently to help buffer speciation across temporal and spatial scales. 

Landmarking coordinates for each species can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/Juniper41/mandibular_morphovariation/tree/main/data)

## Study Systems
This project looks at morphological variation of small mammal dentary bones from Two Ledges Chamber, NV and Homestead Cave, UT over the last ~10,000 years. This is just one of the proxies at understanding how small mammals adapt to a changing landscape. 

The two systems have different anthropogenic histories and resource bases.

## Temporal Scale
This project spans a temporal scale in to the mid holocene. Below is the temporal scale I use and the associated date range for each stratum. 

|Stratum|Two Ledges ybp (Splits)|Homestead ybp (Splits)|
:--|:--|:--|
|1|Modern|Modern|
|2|288 (1-2)|150 (18)|
|3|317 (3-4)|930 (17)|
|4|88 (5-6)|1095 (16)|
|5|1709 (7-8)|3640 (12)|
|6|2251 (9)|5377 (11)|
|7|2597 (10)|6752 (9)|
|8|2955 (11)|N/A|
|9|3553 (12-13)|N/A|
|10|4960 (15-16)|N/A|
|11|6090 (17-18)|N/A|
|12|7556 (19-20)|N/A|

*Stratum*: a layer or a series of layers of rock in the ground
*ypb*: years before present
